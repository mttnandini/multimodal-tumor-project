This project focuses on building a **multimodal tumor classification system** that combines **radiology (MRI/CT scans)** and **pathology (microscopic images)** to improve the accuracy of tumor detection.  
By integrating visual information from both imaging modalities, the model learns a more complete representation of tumor features—offering insights that neither modality can provide alone.
